# Caesar-Cipher
A Python script implementing the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique, allowing users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages with a customizable shift key. It supports text, punctuation, and space preservation.

# Encryption and Decryption Script

## Overview
This Python project demonstrates encryption and decryption techniques using a Caesar Cipher-like method. The script allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value. It handles both text and punctuation characters, ensuring that non-alphabetic characters remain intact during the encryption and decryption process.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Encrypts a plain text message by converting each character to a corresponding number, based on a shift key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted message by converting numbers back into their respective letters based on the same shift key.
- **Punctuation Support**: Preserves punctuation marks like commas, periods, exclamation marks, and question marks.
- **Flexible Shift**: Users can specify a shift (key) to control the encryption and decryption process.
